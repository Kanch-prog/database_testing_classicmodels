# Database Testing: Schema and Functional Testing

This project covers the essentials of database schema and functional testing, ensuring that both the structure and operations of a SQL database meet the required standards.

## Schema Testing

Schema testing focuses on validating the database structure. Key areas include:

- **Table Presence**: Ensuring all necessary tables exist.
- **Naming Conventions**: Verifying that table and column names follow consistent conventions.
- **Column Definitions**: Checking column names, data types, and sizes for accuracy.
- **Nullability**: Ensuring correct null constraints.
- **Key Constraints**: Validating primary and foreign key definitions.

## Functional Testing

Functional testing involves verifying that CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations function correctly. It includes:

- **Insertion Tests**: Ensuring data can be accurately added to tables.
- **Retrieval Tests**: Confirming that data can be correctly retrieved.
- **Update Tests**: Verifying that records can be updated as expected.
- **Deletion Tests**: Ensuring that records can be deleted without issues.
